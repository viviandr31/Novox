In doing so, it misses an opportunity to develop its decent multiplayer component into something that could’ve kept me playing for more than a couple of sittings."

As usual, though, there’s much more to know than most of us care about—it’s all a matter of what your interests are. Taxonomically speaking, a lobster is a marine crustacean of the family Homaridae, characterized by five pairs of jointed legs, the first pair terminating in large pincerish claws used for subduing prey. Like many other species of benthic carnivore, lobsters are both hunters and scavengers. They have stalked eyes, gills on their legs, and antennae. There are dozens of different kinds worldwide, of which the relevant species here is the Maine lobster, Homarus americanus. The name “lobster” comes from the Old English loppestre, which is thought to be a corrupt form of the Latin word for locust combined with the Old English loppe, which meant spider."

Adding confusion to the dull “story” missions is the fact that you can opt to play as one of the Kaiju, the very alien race you’re attempting to eradicate from the planet, and some missions require you to battle other Jaegers (your allies) for no reason. It left me with the impression that this shameless attempt at a plot was simply an afterthought, tacked on for players without Xbox Live Gold. On the other hand, I’m grateful developer Yuke’s Co. sacrificed narrative integrity for a slightly more varied play experience; fighting the same three or four opponents as the same three Jaegers over 25 of these missions would’ve gotten old much faster otherwise."

All this is right there in the encyclopedia. And an arthropod is an invertebrate member of the phylum Arthropoda, which phylum covers insects, spiders, crustaceans, and centipedes/millipedes, all of whose main commonality, besides the absence of a centralized brain-spine assembly, is a chitinous exoskeleton composed of segments, to which appendages are articulated in pairs."

Executing a planned assault he doesn’t see coming is nothing short of satisfying. Although simplistic, the fighting utilizes some clever mechanics that add a dose of strategy to an otherwise-dull affair. Do you alternate punches to bring down both of your opponent’s health bars simultaneously (each mech has two, one for each side), or do you cripple one side before focusing on the other? Every dodge, block, and attack costs you precious energy, turning fights into mini-gambles with every move. These mechanics result in a deliberately slow, calculated brawler that is inviting and accessible. However, the lack of combos, shallow move pool, and sometimes-clunky precision meant I lost interest quickly."
