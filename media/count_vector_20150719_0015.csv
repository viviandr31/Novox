Lacan continued giving these right up until shortly before his death, with le Séminaire running continuously for twenty-seven years. As was the case with Kojève, Lacan exerted his influence primarily through his oral teachings. The first decade of le Séminaire (1953–1963) was taught at the Hôpital Sainte-Anne and had an audience consisting mostly of psychoanalysts. For reasons I will explain shortly, Lacan, in 1964, moved his seminar first to the École Normale Supérieure (1964–1969) and then to the Faculty of Law across from the Panthéon (1969–1980). From 1964 onwards, Lacan's audience startlingly increased in both sheer numbers and breadth of backgrounds, with artists and academics from various disciplines across academia joining the more clinically-minded attendees. "

For instance, such philosophers as Jean Hyppolite, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze, Luce Irigaray, and Julia Kristeva spent time in Lacan's audience. In his seminars, Lacan deftly maneuvered within and between a multitude of theoretical currents, putting psychoanalysis into conversation with the history of philosophy, phenomenology, existentialism, structuralism, post-structuralism, feminism, and, as already indicated, just about every discipline represented in the university. All of the major French philosophers of the generation that came of age in the 1960s and 1970s engaged with Freudian analysis in one way or another, and all of them did so in fashions varyingly informed by Lacan's teachings."

For ten years (1953–1963), the SFP, following its creation after the defections from the SPP, was being scrutinized at length by the IPA as a training institute applying for IPA membership. To cut a long story short, the IPA ended up offering the SFP an ultimatum: It could be admitted only if Lacan was struck from its list of training analysts. Lacan's non-standard “variable-length sessions,” deviating from the fixed-length session rules of IPA orthodoxy, was the main reason for the IPA's withholding of its recognition from him. The SFP accepted this condition, stripping Lacan of his standing within it. In the aftermath of what he understandably experienced as a deeply wounding betrayal, he abandoned his original plans for a 1963–1964 seminar on The Names-of-the-Father (only its opening session of November 20, 1963 was given), relocated his teaching from the Hôpital Sainte-Anne to the École Normale Supérieure, and conducted his deservedly renowned eleventh seminar of 1964, The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis (with Lacan identifying these four concepts as the unconscious, repetition, the transference, and the drive).

However traumatic this blow, it seemed to prompt Lacan to come even more into his own, to forge a distinctly Lacanian battery of ideas and terms—and this by contrast with the more familiar Freudian language and apparatus of the first decade of le Séminaire (1953–1963). Although not without many precedents in his prior work, a Lacanianism distinct from Freudianism began to emerge clearly into view in the mid-1960s. In the shadow of his rejection by the IPA and departure from the SFP, Lacan founded his own analytic organization, the École freudienne de Paris. This new institutional framework (and freedom) provided him with a setting in which to experiment with novel approaches to analytic teaching and training."

These “writings” provide very daunting and demanding paths of entry into Lacanian thinking (the annual seminars are comparatively more reader-friendly and transparent).

Lacan hoped thereby to avoid being misinterpreted in the ways that Freud's deceptively accessible employments of natural language allegedly allowed most non-Lacanian post-Freudians to perpetrate. Additionally, topology, as a science of surfaces, provided Lacan with resources for his regular assaults on the crude, popular images of psychoanalysis as a “depth psychology,” with these images relying upon the simplistic two- and three-dimensional Euclidean spaces of spontaneous picture thinking. Topological figures and constructions undermining the intuitions of this picture thinking assisted Lacan in recasting the unconscious as an ensemble of contortions, curvings, folding, inflections, twists, and turns immanent and internal to a single plane of minded subjectivity accessible to rigorous, rational (psycho)analysis."

Therein, he purported to uncover an inherent, ineliminable structural discrepancy/gap separating the sexes, an inescapable condemnation of sexed subjects to being essentially, necessarily out-of-sync with each other (and even with themselves as split subjects). Lacan summarized this with an infamous one-liner: “Il n'y a pas de rapport sexuel” (There is no sexual relationship). This declaration scandalized many at the time.

Scouts have raised the question of whether Bogaerts' long-term future will be at shortstop. With his size and 30-home run potential, he could slide over to third base — where the Red Sox have used him a few times — or convert to the outfield."

But offensive performers who can play a prime position such as shortstop are rare and extremely valuable, and Red Sox second baseman Dustin Pedroia is among those who think size should not be an issue. ""He's a great athlete. He moves well. He's quick. He's got a ton of ability,"" Pedroia says of Bogaerts. ""I didn't know there was a height and weight requirement. I didn't know it was like a Disney ride: 'You have to be this tall to play this position.' ""Troy Tulowitzki is 6-5 (actually 6-3) and he's the best defensive shortstop in the big leagues. It doesn't matter."""

Baseball in Aruba is not as developed as in neighboring Curacao, a fellow former Dutch Antille that has produced Andruw Jones, Randall Simon, Kenley Jansen, Jair Jurrjens, Meulens, Simmons and Profar, among others. ""In Aruba we don't have stadiums with grass,"" said Bogaerts, who was used to playing on rocky fields. ""A few years back they made one of artificial turf. That's the only one we have."""

Even though their father, Jan Bogaerts, moved away to pursue business interests in Hong Kong — Xander Bogaerts said he hadn't seen him in years — the twins and older sister Chandra grew up in a stable environment. Their mother, Sandra Brown, a social worker who deals with domestic violence issues, kept the family grounded with help from Glenroy. Bogaerts credits her for the poise and maturity that characterize him. ""It's a great Christian family. They're really solid,"" says Mike Lord, the former Red Sox scout who signed both brothers on the same day."
